# Building Automation Tools
Project consists of bash and python scripting to rebuild existing tools and build own tools for our service requirements

I created.

• Script to automatically update the system (update_system.sh)

• Email Spoofing Detector (spoof_detector.py)

• Mini Nmap (port_scanner.py)

• Password Generator (password_generator.py)

• Detector of intrusion which sends email as an alert (ips_detector.py)
